# Introduction

Hi, I'm Ethan Cox and I'm an honors student at student at High Point University studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I am also minoring 
in Chinese (Mandarin).

# Cybersecurity and Programming
I primarily program in C++, however I also know Python and do a bit of Bash and C. I enjoy programming a great deal and I spent a lot of time on
deepening my knowledge of C++ and other low-level languages. I have an interest in low-level programming and hacking, specifically IoT and application security/exploitation.<br />
