# Introduction

Hi, I'm Ethan Cox and I'm currently a student at High Point University studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I am also minoring in Chinese (Mandarin).

# Cybersecurity and Programming
I primarily program in C++, however I also know Python and do a bit of Bash, C, and x86 Assembly (AT&T Style). I enjoy programming a great deal and I spent a lot of time on
deepening my knowledge of C++ and other low-level languages. I have an interest in low-level programming and hacking, specifically IoT and application security/exploitation.
Right now, I'm working on a text adventure game that runs on the Linux terminal - [this link](https://github.com/EthanC2/CPP-Text-Adventure-Game) for my progress.
