# Introduction

Hi, I'm Ethan Cox and I'm an honors student at student at High Point University studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I am also minoring 
in Chinese (Mandarin).

# Cybersecurity and Programming
I primarily program in C++, but I also do some C#. I enjoy programming a great deal and I spent a lot of time on
deepening my knowledge of C++ and programming in general. I have an interest in low-level programming and hacking, specifically IoT and application security/exploitation.<br />
