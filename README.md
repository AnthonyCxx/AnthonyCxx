Hi,

I'm Ethan Cox and I'm currently a student at High Point University studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. <br />I am also minoring in Chinese (Mandarin).

I primarily program in C++, however I also know Python and do a bit of Bash, C, and x86 Assembly (AT&T Style). I enjoy programming a great deal and I spent a lot of time on
deepening
my knowledge of C++ and other low-level languages. I have an interest in low-level programming and hacking, specifically IoT and application security/exploitation.

All my projects are made available to the public through the BSD 3-Clause License. 
If you have any questions about my projects, please contact me at ecox@highpoint.edu

I reserve my private email, but am willing to give it out if contacted through my school email first.
